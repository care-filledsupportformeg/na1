                        <li><span class="highlight">"To Remove Our Shortcomings":</span> "Shortcomings" are the defects of character identified in Step Four and for which we became ready to part with in Step Six. The request is for their removal or transformation.</li>

                        <p>Humility is the indispensable ingredient of Step Seven. It involves <span class="highlight">recognizing our own insufficiency</span> to overcome our defects and approaching our Higher Power with genuine openness and a lack of pretense.</p>

                        <p>Step Seven reflects a deep desire not just to stop using drugs, but to <span class="highlight">undergo a fundamental change in character</span>, to become a better, healthier, and more spiritually aligned person.</p>

                        <p>Humbly asking requires <span class="highlight">faith that our Higher Power can help</span> and trust that the process of recovery, including the removal of shortcomings, will unfold as it should.</p>

                        <p>The removal of shortcomings is rarely a one-time event. Step Seven often becomes a <span class="highlight">daily practice</span> of asking for help with defects as they arise, fostering ongoing spiritual development.</p>

                        <p>This step is about truly <span class="highlight">letting go of the character defects</span> we identified and became willing to part with. It's an act of surrender, trusting our Higher Power to do what we cannot do for ourselves.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="mt-6 text-center text-lg font-medium text-sky-800">
                    Step Seven is a profound expression of humility and faith. By humbly asking for the removal of our shortcomings, we open ourselves to the transformative power of our Higher Power and take a significant step towards spiritual freedom.
